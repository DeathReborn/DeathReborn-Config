# Death Reborn Config
This project includes customized configurations optimized for best gameplay experience. It is intended to be used with our collection Death Reborn, but it can be used even if you are not using Death Reborn addon collection. This requires [Left 4 Bots](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2279814689) and [Left 4 Lib](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2634208272) or [Death Reborn](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2319991144) to be installed to work properly.

# Installation
## Normal installation
Note: Before installing, if you have existing autoexec.cfg, please back up your settings inside autoexec.cfg first before doing this action!

1. On the [releases](https://github.com/DeathReborn/DeathReborn-Config/releases/latest) page, choose which edition or variants do you want to download and select the ZIP file to download. (We have Normal, Pro)
2. Extract the ZIP file then move left4dead2 folder on your local files (It can be easily accessed via Left 4 Dead 2 > Properties > Local Files > Browse...)
3. If you wish to add custom config(Which acts like autoexec.cfg), create file named `custom.cfg` on `left4dead2/cfg` folder
4. If you have existing autoexec commands, copy all of them to custom.cfg
5. Now launch the game and you are good to go! Feel free to customize the script if required.

## NoAutoExec version installation
Note: Since it doesn't replace the `autoexec.cfg`, you don't need to worry about backing up your own customization for this variants.

1. On the [releases](https://github.com/DeathReborn/DeathReborn-Config/releases/latest) page, choose which edition or variants do you want to download and select the ZIP file to download. (We have Normal-NoAutoExec, Pro-NoAutoExec)
